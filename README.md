# BoilerPlate Node.js Application

Since I prefer jqtpl to jade, I made this boilerplate node app to
clone when I need it.

## Details:

  * Basic Express app with:
    * Static files served from /public/(css|js|images)
    * jqtpl views
    * less css
    * Application settings in settings.js
    * Application helpers in helpers.js
  * .gitignore excludes
    * node_modules/*
    * public/css/*.css  (your styles should be .less files)


### Dont Forget to run <code>npm install</code>
